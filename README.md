<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Call-Connect is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate real-time problem-solving by connecting users who need assistance with others who are willing to help. Logged-in users can create detailed problem tickets describing their issues, and other users can join in to collaborate and offer solutions in private chat rooms. Whether it's troubleshooting technical problems, seeking advice, or providing expertise, Call-Connect enables seamless, real-time communication between users.

The platform is built with modern web technologies and integrates Socket.IO for real-time messaging, allowing users to engage in dynamic conversations without delays. Additionally, users can choose between free and premium account options, each offering tailored features and support based on their needs. This premium model helps sustain the platform while offering added benefits to power users.

Key Features:
- User Account Creation and Authentication: Powered by Clerk for secure and streamlined user authentication.
- Real-Time Collaboration: Instant messaging within private rooms using Socket.IO, enabling efficient problem-solving.
- Problem Tickets: Logged-in users can create, manage, and join problem tickets that describe their issues in detail.
- Private Messaging Rooms: Each ticket is assigned a private room where users can collaborate in real time to resolve the issue.
- Premium and Free Accounts:
  Free accounts allow users to create and join a limited number of problem tickets.
  Premium accounts offer enhanced features such as unlimited ticket creation, and unlimited messages per account.

        'Your Database path relative to this file location',
         err => {
